I am a French-speaking Junior Full Stack Developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy, Europe's leading software development bootcamp.

After graduating with a first class honours degree in French and History, I joined the Digital team of a multinational insurance company as a Digital Marketing Manager working in daily collaboration with front-end developers, testers, designers and project managers. Within the team, we adopted tools such as JIRA and agile practices such as daily stand-ups and the use of a Kanban workflow and this is where I developed an initial interest in programming. 

My interest developed further when I was selected alongside four senior leaders to launch the company's first start-up venture where technology was used as an enabler in rapidly bringing a proposition to market as we iterated and tested different hypotheses. 

I have experience using:

**Technologies:** Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, jQuery, Git, HTML, CSS<br>

**Testing frameworks:** RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Mocha, Chai, Cypress<br>

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, Sequelize, TablePlus, MongoDB, ActiveRecord<br>

**Other:** Git, GitHub, JIRA, Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Optimizely, Response Tap<br>

## Skills

#### Strong communicator
Studying and working in France and navigating a different culture was a great test of my communication skills. Success in my role as an English teacher relied entirely upon my ability to both engage and adapt my communication style to meet the needs of my students and their varying levels of ability. 

In my previous role as a Digital Marketing Manager for Domestic & General, I regularly presented analysis and recommendations to internal senior directors and to our client partners including AO.com, Argos and the Whirlpool Group. This involved deconstructing often complex terminology and presenting insights in a succinct manner. 

These skills have proved to be invaluable whilst learning to code at Makers Academy and have enabled me to articulate my thoughts clearly with pair programming partners and lead productive stand-ups and retros when working in groups.

#### Analytical thinker
My experience working within the digital marketing sector has allowed me to sharpen my analytical skillset and appreciate the wider commercial context in which an organisation operates. 

I am adept at observing trends and drawing actionable insights from large data sets to drive efficiencies. In my previous role as a Digital Marketing Manager for example, I was responsible for developing the organisation's paid search acquisition strategy and identified opportunities for growth resulting in a 24% increase in conversion alongside a reduction in cost per acquisition year on year. As a result of these efforts, Domestic & General was shortlisted for an award at the [UK Search Awards](http://www.searchawards.co.uk/shortlist) in 2017.

#### Problem solver
I try to approach problems by thoroughly analysing the issue at hand, seeking feedback from stakeholders to identify where pain points exist and then reviewing possible solutions from different perspectives before embarking on a course of action. 

In my role as a Digital Marketing Manager for example, I found that the process used to collate paid search data was manual, inefficient and unnecessary lengthy. After speaking to the various users of the data, I identified that accuracy and timeliness were sources of frustration. Drawing on my Microsoft Excel skills, I developed a series of automated worksheets that pulled in raw data from a range of different sources each morning. Automating the process not only saved time but also made it significantly easier to monitor historic trends and identify new opportunities for commercial growth. 

Whilst learning to code, I have built upon these skills further by always seeking to break down problems into their component parts and working through each part systematically.
