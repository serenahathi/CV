I am a French-speaking Junior Full Stack Developer and a recent graduate of Makers Academy, Europe's leading software development bootcamp.

After graduating with a first class honours degree in French and History, I joined the Digital team of a multinational insurance company as a Digital Marketing Manager, working in daily collaboration with front-end developers, testers, designers and project managers. Within the team, we adopted tools such as JIRA and agile practices such as daily standups and the use of a Kanban workflow and this is where I developed my interest in programming.

Personal highlights from my career so far include being selected alongside four senior leaders to develop and launch the company’s first startup venture which went on to receive the highest customer rating in the sector to becoming a certified Google AdWords practitioner and being shortlisted for a [UK Search Award](http://www.searchawards.co.uk/shortlist).
