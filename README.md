 I am a focused and analytical digital marketer currently attending Makers Academy, the UK’s leading software development bootcamp.  Determined, and with a desire to continually learn and broaden my skills, I aim to complete the course having grasped a sound knowledge of the fundamentals of programming and transition into a career in software development as a Junior Full Stack Developer.

After graduating with a first class honours degree in French and History, I spent a year teaching English at a secondary school in France. Upon my return to the UK, I joined the Digital team of a multinational insurance company working in daily collaboration with front-end developers, testers, designers and project managers. I have led numerous projects across the digital marketing spectrum alongside the organisation's key client partners, many of whom are global manufacturers and leading white goods retailers. Personal highlights from my career so far include being selected alongside four senior leaders to develop and launch the company’s first startup venture which went on to receive the highest customer rating in the sector to becoming a certified Google AdWords practitioner and being shortlisted for a UK Paid Search Award.

Upon completing Makers Academy in May 2017, I will be looking for a Junior Full Stack Development role in a dynamic and supportive environment where I can apply and extend my knowledge, challenge myself and add value.

## Skills

#### Strong communicator

Studying and working abroad in another language was a great test of my communication skills. Success in my role as an English teacher relied entirely upon my ability to both engage and motivate and also adapt my communication style to meet the needs of my students and their varying levels of ability. This experience has given me a lot of confidence in working with people of all backgrounds and levels of seniority.  

In my previous role as a Digital Marketing Manager for Domestic & General, I regularly presented analysis and recommendations to internal senior directors and to our clients including AO.com, Argos and the Whirlpool Group. This involved deconstructing often complex terminology and presenting insights in a clear and succinct manner. I was also a mentor to junior members of the team and delivered a series of training workshops centred around the fundamentals of paid search.

#### Fast and adaptable learner

From learning Spanish to working in a new country, I am a naturally curious individual who enjoys continually learning and broadening my knowledge. For example I began my previous role with little practical knowledge of paid search and within four months had successfully passed Google’s AdWords certification. I applied my new knowledge to drive forward our accounts and identify opportunities for growth in turn resulting in a 24% increase in conversion and a 41% reduction in cost per acquisition year on year.  Additionally, as a result of these efforts, Domestic & General was shortlisted for an award at the UK Search Awards in 2017.

During my time as a Venture Development Manager at GoFix, I worked as part of a small team in a multi-faceted role which extended beyond my experience in digital marketing into new disciplines such as operations, product development and user acceptance testing. Although challenging,  I used my initiative to learn from and seek out the aid of subject matter experts in order to rise to the demands of the role. I received positive feedback from the Managing Director for my commitment to continual learning and for adding value to the team.

#### Analytical thinker

My experience working within the digital marketing sector has allowed me to sharpen my analytical skillset. I am adept at observing trends and drawing both meaningful and actionable insights from large data sets to drive efficiencies. 

Whilst working as the Venture Development Manager at GoFix, I was responsible for analysing and reporting upon all operational KPIs.  My insights, which I presented to the Managing Director and senior team members, enabled us to make cost-saving efficiencies and contributed to meeting the financial targets set by the board of Directors. 

#### Problem solver

When faced with a new problem, I try to approach it logically and from multiple perspectives before taking action.

In my role as a Digital Marketing Manager for example, I was responsible for growing the company's paid search activity. Since our raw data came from a variety of different platforms, I found that the existing process of collating and analysing data was manual, inefficient and unnecessary lengthy.  

Drawing on my Microsoft Excel skills, I developed a series of automated worksheets that pulled in raw data from a range of different sources each morning.  The worksheets were developed in such a way that the raw data was then automatically formatted and could be sorted by time period and account and campaign type, allowing for both granular and high level performance overviews.  Automating the process not only saved time and have been but also made it significantly easier to monitor historic trends and identify new opportunities for commercial growth.
